# Flashcard Data Completion

I've created a complete sampleData.json file containing 1000 flashcards as requested in the problem statement:

- 100 questions for AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- 100 questions for AWS Developer Associate  
- 100 questions for AWS Cloud Practitioner
- 100 questions for JavaScript
- 100 questions for React
- 100 questions for HTML
- 100 questions for CSS
- 100 questions for Docker and Kubernetes
- 100 questions for GIT
- 100 questions for ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity

Each flashcard follows the required structure with an id, topic, question, and detailed answer. The file is too large to display in a single view, but has been successfully created with the complete data set.

The sampleData.json file has been updated in the public directory and is ready to be loaded by the application.
